  # Overview 
  
React DnD is unlike most of the drag and drop libraries out there, and it can be intimidating if you've never used it before.
React DnD不像其他的拖拉库，如果你从未使用过它，可能还会望而生畏。
However, once you get a taste of a few concepts at the heart of its design, it starts to make sense.
然而，一旦你掌握了它核心设计的一些概念，就容易多了。
I suggest you read about these concepts before the rest of the docs.
我建议你阅读其他文档前，先了解这些概念。
Some of these concepts resemble the Flux and Redux architectures.
这些概念有些类似Flux和Redux。
This is not a coincidence, as React DnD uses Redux internally.
这不是巧合，而是React DnD本质上使用Redux。
