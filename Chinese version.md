  # Overview 
  

React DnD is unlike most of the drag and drop libraries out there, and it can be intimidating if you've never used it before.
However, once you get a taste of a few concepts at the heart of its design, it starts to make sense.
I suggest you read about these concepts before the rest of the docs.

Some of these concepts resemble the Flux and Redux architectures.
This is not a coincidence, as React DnD uses Redux internally.
