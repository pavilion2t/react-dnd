  # Adding the Drag and Drop Interaction 

This is the part that actually prompted me to write this tutorial. We are now going to see how easy React DnD makes it to add some drag and drop interaction to your existing components.

This part assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with the concepts presented in the overview, such as the backends, the collecting functions, the types, the items, the drag sources, and the drop targets. If you didn't understand everything, it's fine, but make sure you at least give it a chance before jumping into the coding process.

We're going to start by installing React DnD and the HTML5 backend for it:

npm install --save react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
In the future, you might want to explore alternative third-party backends, such as the touch backend, but this is out of scope of this tutorial.

The first thing we need to set up in our app is the DragDropContext. We need it to specify that we're going to use the HTML5 backend in our app.
